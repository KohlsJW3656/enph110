          <p>
            Wildfires play a key role in shaping ecosystems by serving as an
            agent of renewal and change. But fire can be deadly, destroying
            homes, wildlife habitat and timber, and polluting the air with
            emissions harmful to human health. Fire also releases carbon
            dioxide—a key greenhouse gas—into the atmosphere.

              <p>
                Large patches of high-severity fire can hinder the ability of an
                ecosystem to recover, potentially undermining conservation of
                native biodiversity by long-term or permanent loss of native
                vegetation, expansion of non-native and invasive species, and
                long-term or permanent loss of essential habitat for native
                species.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Grazing and fires are linked to plant invasions. Gaps created by
                high-intensity fires are particularly susceptible to invasion by
                exotic species. Invasive species reduces the biodiversity of an
                area through allelopathic pathways.​

            <li>
              <p>
                The biggest effect fire has on wildlife is the change in their
                habitats. Fire changes the proportion, arrangement, and
                characteristic of habitats across the landscape. Immediately
                after a fire, there can be temporary loss of food and shelter.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Animal populations may shift from species that prefer cool,
                moist conditions to ones that prefer warm, dry conditions.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Herbivores and species that prefer herbaceous vegetation for
                cover prefer the grass/forb habitats or broad-leafed forests
                that often become established after a burn.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Fire-killed trees become food for millions of insect larvae
                and/or snags that provide perches for raptors. Snags and downed
                woody debris also provide important habitat for cavity nesters,
                reptiles, small mammals, and even large mammals such as bears.

                Bodies of water such as streams and rivers that flow through a
                fire burned area can be altered.
              </p>

                Impacts from wildfires can be detrimental to aquatic species.
                Fires can make the streams warmer which is not good for fish
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Changes to the water flow or volume of the water can also occur
                from wildfires.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Wildfires can increase volume of water because more is running
                off the slope or through the soil instead of being drawn up by
                plants.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Debris will flow or landslides can occur, and these may alter
                the course of a stream. Following wildfires, harmful sediment
                can also enter streams along with any runoff.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                However, some of the sediment that infiltrates the water is
                filled with nutrients for insects, which in turn becomes great
                food for fish and plants.
